  This paper presents the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in both video game development and graphical processing. 
  It will cover topics such as frame generation, Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 
  Which help to drastically improve graphical performance by using AI-driven techniques without relying solely on raw hardware performance. 
  This paper will also cover applications of generative AI in Game development analysing its potential benefits and ethical challenges which it presents.

The first area we will cover in this paper is DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling). DLSS is a
technology developed by Nvidia for Nvidia GPUs (Graphical Processing Units/Graphics card). 
DLSS only works on Nvidia GPUs and does not work on other companies GPUs like AMD FSR
does. DLSS has many “neural rendering technologies” those being: Multi Frame Generation, 
Super Resolution and Deep learning Anti-aliasing.

The first of which we will cover is “Multi Frame Generation”. Multi Frame Generation boosts FPS
(Frames per second) up to three frames rendered per frame by using Artificial intelligence (See Figure three)
predict the next upcoming frames. While this technology can improve frame rate by up to three
times (See Figure Four) it comes with the drawback of latency as the latency of the number of frames you usually
generate remain the same. Another drawback of multi frame generation is the higher the
multiplier is, the less accurate the frames become. Many users report “artificing” (Visual
distortions or anomalies) at the highest multiplier but much less at lower frame generation.

The next “neural rendering” technology we will cover is “Super Resolution”. This is much more 
refined than Frame Generation as it does not suffer from the drawbacks of noticeable latency.
Super resolution boosts the raw power of graphical processing by rendering multiple lower-
resolution images with feedback from previous frames to reconstruct the image but at a much
higher resolution. There are usually multiple settings to this and if the difference is resolution is
small there is not a noticeable difference however, if the images the AI is using is much lower
than the resolution you are aiming to render at it can cause details to be lost. (See Figure Two for 
performance impact)

The final DLSS technology we will talk about in this paper is “Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing”
(DLAA). Anti-Aliasing is a technology that removes jagged edges on computer screens by either
blending colours together or making a colour slowly fade over multiple pixels (See Figure one). 
Anti-aliasing usually takes a lot of processing power to render specially if you
are rendering multiple frames. This makes DLAA a useful technology as it is much lighter on the 
load to the GPU as it uses the same technology that Super Resolution does. Unfortunately,
though, the frames generated by DLAA are not the same as if standard Anti-Aliasing is used as
there are noticeable artifacts on objects if they are moving on each frame similar to an after image.

AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) essentially the functions the same as DLSS with the
exception that it can be used on any GPU Nvidia, Intel and AMD. This fills the gap where DLSS
cannot be used as not all Nvidia GPUs (Older models) can use it. DLSS is often considered to be
the better option though, especially if you have a compatible Nvidia GPU.

The next area we will be covering in this paper is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Video
games. Ai has a variety of uses in video games when the game is being developed. These 
include the use of AI for voice acting, the use of AI for programming the game, and the use of AI
for NPCs (Non player characters).

The first area we will cover on this topic is the use of AI in voice acting. A popular game called
“The Finals” was and is currently using AI for its voice acting. These AI are trained on someone’s
voice to replicate it. While this technology has come really far the past couple of years, you can 
usually notice as the voices lack emotion. The negative of this is it will mean someone will lose a
job but, a job may be gained to train the AI and step in if more training is needed. The benefit of 
this is it saves money and a lot of development time on updates as you will not need the person
to come in and perfectly record every line.

The next area we will cover on this topic is the use of AI for programming, this doesn’t just fall
under game development but for everything. AIs like Chatgpt 5.0 have become very proficient
with programming however, when needing to code something that may take hundreds or
thousands of lines of code the AI usually doesn’t cope very well and makes many mistakes. I
often find these mistakes are when a UI (User interface) is needed. At the current moment, AI
works better for certain programming languages and often makes mistakes but, AI can be used 
as an effective tool to make programmers lives easier by writing out code that may otherwise
take hours.

Finally, the last thing we will be talking about is the use of AI in NPCs. NPCs can be programmed
to use a general-purpose AI such as Chatgpt to have a unique dialogue every single time you talk
to them. This adds replay ability to the game as no interaction will be the same. While this is yet
to be widely adopted by the gaming industry it will likely soon be implemented.
